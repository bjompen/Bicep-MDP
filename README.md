# MDPBicep
This is the code I use to deploy Managed DevOps pools. The primary goal is to support [AzDM](https://github.com/AZDOPS/AzDM), but it should be usable for most scenarios with little customizations.

Some things are excluded by choice as I don't see a reason to add support for everything right now.

Use it at your own will - and feel free to ask for changes or improvements.
